## Abstract

In this report based on the Titanic Kaggle Competition, we built a machine
learning model to predict who would survive the Titanic Shipwreck. We first
reviewed and cleaned the data, and found that age, gender, and class are the
most important variables. Then, we used the K-Nearest Neighbor machine
learning model along with the Random Forest Classifier model to analyze and
predict the data. This resulted in the Random Forest Classifier being more
accurate in predicting the titanic mortality.
